# center of mass

Uniform, solid objects have their CoM at...you guessed it, the center. But what about other objects? Below is the center of mass for a system of 2 particles, where x1 and x2 are their distances from the origin.&#x20;

Extending this to a system of many, many points on the x-axis, we would have to sum all of their respective CoM's together, to form this very cool equation where M = total mass of all points.

If there are multiple dimensions, repeat the same thing, except sum the distance based on the y/z axis.

Extending this to many, many, many particles inside a solid object, we'd now need to make use of _integration_! Similarly, we differentiate by the smoll masses of these particles to find the coordinates of the CoM: ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (12) (1).png>)
