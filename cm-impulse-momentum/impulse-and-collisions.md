# impulse & collisions

### Impulse

When 2 objects collide, they exert forces on each other, causing their linear momentums to change. Say we want to find the total change in momentum of one of the objects. Going back to the equation ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png>) - if we integrate dp over the total time interval (ti -> tf), then we can get the **total change in momentum of the object**, also known as **impulse, or J.**&#x20;

****![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (18).png>)**,** where F is the force exerted on the object, and Δp is the object's total change in momentum.

These 2 graphs have the area under the curve, or impulse J. We can use the **average force** exerted on the object instead of F(t), how the force changes based on time, to simplify the calculation into just **J =** **F(avg) \* Δt**.
