# linear momentum

### One Particle

The linear momentum (p) of an object is its mass (m) \* its velocity (v). ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (33) (1).png>) If a particle is moving at a high velocity, it has high momentum. If 2 objects are moving at the same speed, the heavier object has a higher momentum.

Rewriting it using Newton's Second Law (F = ma), F = mv/t = p/t. ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (20).png>)

This means that if a force is applied on an object for a small amount of time (dt), the object's momentum will change slightly (dp). In general terms, **the net external force on a particle changes its linear momentum.** Conversely, if there is no net external force, the linear momentum of a particle _cannot_ change.&#x20;

### System of Particles

How do we calculate the net linear momentum of a **system of particles**, in which each particle has its own mass, speed, and linear momentum? <mark style="background-color:green;">We multiply the total mass M of the system and the speed v of its</mark> <mark style="background-color:green;"></mark><mark style="background-color:green;">**center of mass**</mark><mark style="background-color:green;">.</mark>  ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png>) and therefore ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (25).png>)

The rules above apply: only a net external force can change the linear momentum of a system of particles.

### Conservation of Linear Momentum

This law states that in a **closed & isolated system** with no net **external force** acting on it, the linear momentum must stay **constant** even with internal changes:&#x20;

In other words, the system's **initial momentum** must **equal** the system's **final momentum**:

A mechanical system must be defined in order to determine which forces are internal/external. Internal forces are forces that are exchanged by objects **inside the mechanical system.** This often includes collisions amongst the objects. External forces are forces acting on the objects **outside the system.** Usually if we don't include Earth in the system, then gravity/normal force/friction may be considered external.
