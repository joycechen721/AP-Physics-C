# linear momentum

### One Particle

The linear momentum (p) of an object is its mass (m) \* its velocity (v). ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (33) (1).png>) If a particle is moving at a high velocity, it has high momentum. If 2 objects are moving at the same speed, the heavier object has a higher momentum.

Rewriting it using Newton's Second Law (F = ma), F = mv/t = p/t. ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (20).png>)

The net external force on a particle changes its linear momentum. Conversely, if there is no net external force, the linear momentum of a particle _cannot_ change.&#x20;

### System of Particles

How do we calculate the net linear momentum of a **system of particles**, in which each particle has its own mass, speed, and linear momentum? <mark style="background-color:green;">We multiply the total mass M of the system and the speed v of its</mark> <mark style="background-color:green;"></mark><mark style="background-color:green;">**center of mass**</mark><mark style="background-color:green;">.</mark>&#x20;

The rules above apply: only a net external force can change the linear momentum of a system.
