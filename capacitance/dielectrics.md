# dielectrics

When a dielectric is placed between the capacitor plates, the **capacitance increases by a factor of κ**. This means more charge can be stored to create the same potential difference.

**C = κ\*C(air)**, where C(air) is the capacitance when there's nothing but air separating the plates. In other words, κ = C/C0.

Dielectric constants are usually inherent to the insulating material. Below are some common dielectrics and their κ values:

### dielectrics & e-field

For a _fixed_ distribution of charges, the effect of a dielectric is to **weaken the electric field**. When you use **gauss's law** on a capacitor w/ a dielectric, remember that **EA = q/(κε0)** and therefore **E = q/(Aκε0)**! E becomes smaller than if there were no dielectric in the capacitor.
