## Capacitors in Series&#x20;

The capacitances of series capacitors add up like resistors in parallel:

Below, we see that a series of capacitors of capacitances C1, C2, and C3 can be lumped together to form a _single capacitor of value Ctotal_ (using equation above). A crucial point is that these capacitors **all have identical charge q**, due to a "chain reaction" of charges induced top->bottom.

The voltage across each capacitor, then, would be only different due to its individual capacitance: **V = q/C**. These voltage differences **add up to the potential difference of the battery**. With these points in mind, we can calculate the total capacitance of the circuit, the voltage across each capacitor, the charge, etc.

## **Capacitors in Parallel**

Capacitors in parallel add up like resistors in series: easy and simple, you just ADD!!

Again, we can lump the capacitors into a single capacitor of capacitance Ctotal. A crucial point to note is that **capacitors in parallel have the** **same voltage difference**.&#x20;

Then, V(battery) = qtotal/Ctotal = q1/C1 = q2/C2 = q3/C3.&#x20;

Or, to put it another way, **V(battery) = V1 = V2 = V3.**

Unlike capacitors in series, capacitors in parallel do NOT have the same charges as the current across each branch of the circuit is different.&#x20;
