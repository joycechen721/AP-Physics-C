# potential energy

We know that an electric field E is formed in a capacitor. That means work is done transferring an electron from one plate to the other.&#x20;

**dW = V' dq' = q'/C dq'** (with an extra increment of charge, an extra increment of work is done). integrating this, we get --> ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (14).png>)

**^^ THIS IS THE POTENTIAL ENERGY "U" STORED IN THE CAPACITOR - aka work needed to move charge from 1 plate to the other.**

_Important Key Concepts_

* __![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (6) (1) (1).png>)if 2 capacitors have **identical charges & area**, no matter the distance of separation, they would have the **same electric field**.
* **Greater distance of separation, greater potential energy** (C = ÎµA/d).
