# Dielectrics

When a dielectric is placed between the capacitor plates, the **capacitance increases by a factor of κ**. This means more charge can be stored to create the same potential difference.

**C = κ\*C(air)**, where C(air) is the capacitance when there's nothing but air separating the plates. Ibn other words, κ = C/C0.

For a _fixed_ distribution of charges, the effect of a dielectric is to **weaken the electric field**. Dielectric constants are usually inherent to the insulating material. Below are some common dielectrics and their κ values:
