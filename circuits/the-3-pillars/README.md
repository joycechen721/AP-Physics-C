  in order to fully understand circuits, we need to know the 3 fundamental
  "parts" that make up a circuit: voltage, current, and resistance.

# the 3 pillars

**Voltage**: created by an emf device that maintains a potential difference, such as a battery

**Current**: generated by voltage across a conductor; charges flow from high --> low potential

**Resistance**: hinders the current from moving forward. all materials have some degree of resistivity that causes resistance against current
