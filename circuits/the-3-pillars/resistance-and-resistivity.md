# resistance & resistivity

### Resistance (the ohm, Ω)

All materials including conductors have some electrical resistance, meaning it impedes the current. To find the resistance is simple: _**R = V/i**_, where _V_ is the potential difference applied across the conductor and _i_ is the current flowing through it. WIth this equation, we see that **the greater the resistance, the smaller the current would be**.

#### Resistors

These are conductors that give a _**specific** _ **resistance**, denoted by the symbol ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (8) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>) in a circuit. Below are how to read resistor values.

#### Resistivity (ϼ) - the opposite of conductivity! quite literally!

Different materials have different resistivities, which is the reciprocal of their conductivities. Resistivity is an **inherent property** **of the material**, but they **increase with temperature**.&#x20;

The resistance is directly proportional to the resistivity (ϼ) and length of the material (L), and inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area (A). Greater resistivity values, longer wires, smaller cross section = greater resistance.
