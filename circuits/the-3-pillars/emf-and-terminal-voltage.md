# emf & terminal voltage

### EMF Device (battery)

* maintains a potential difference between 2 terminals by providing an _emf_ (electromotive force, measured in Volts) & thus doing work on charges
* pushes positive charge carriers from - to + terminal, from **low to high potential**
* energy in device to produce this work comes from battery, fuel cells, solar cells, etc.
* **ideal**: lacks internal resistance. **real**: potential difference < emf

### Internal Resistance

(see "single-loop circuits" for how to use potential method around circuit)

If no internal resistance is specified, assume that the battery is ideal since internal resistance is usually pretty small.

**Terminal voltage** is the actual voltage difference of the battery when you account for internal resistance. When no current is running through the battery, terminal voltage = emf!
