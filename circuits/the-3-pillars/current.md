# current

Current is the rate at which charge passes a point. Charge, meaning there needs to be a **NET movement of charge**. If charges are just randomly moving in both directions of a wire, that isn't a current, since they cancel out. **i = dq/dt**.

Conventional current is the flow of positive charge carriers, so the current direction points from the positive to the negative terminal (electrons would flow opposite).&#x20;

Current is **scalar**, or they can be added algebraically. Any arrows just indicate the direction of current flow and do NOT signify a vector. In a circuit, current is **conserved** and can be split into different directions:

### Current Density

amount of current passing through a perpendicular cross-sectional area.
