# current

In AP Physics, we consider current to be composed of **a steady, net movement of conduction electrons** **through metallic conductors** (ie. wires). Currents are generated when there is a **potential difference** across the conductor, and E-fields exert force on the electrons. If charges are just randomly moving in both directions of a wire, that is NOT a current since they cancel out.&#x20;

**i = dq/dt**. Units are **Amperes (A)**, or Coulombs/second (C/s).

Conventional current is the flow of _positive_ charge carriers, so the current direction points from the positive to the negative terminal (electrons would flow opposite).&#x20;

Current is **scalar**, or they can be added algebraically. Any arrows just indicate the direction of current flow and do NOT signify a vector. In a circuit, current is **conserved** and can be split into different directions:

![i0 = i1 + i2](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (10) (1) (1).png>)

### Current Density J

The current density is the amount of current passing through a cross-sectional area (A/m^2), and is a vector quantity (J). &#x20;

![current = sum of all current densities across a cross section](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (13) (1) (1).png>)

In a wire, the area vector and J would all point in the _same direction_ - however the current is flowing! Thus, if the current is uniform and parallel to the area vector, we can simplify the equation into i = JA or **J = i/A**.

![closer streamlines = greater current density, since A is smaller.](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (17) (1) (1) (1).png>)

### Drift Speed Vd

The drift speed of electrons is what makes up a current. In a metallic conductor without current, free electrons move randomly, bouncing off positive ions as shown below by the solid line. With current, the electrons don't just magically start moving in a straight line towards the positive terminal -- rather, they **maintain this random movement but are now pushed by an electric force** as shown by the dotted line. This drifting of electrons is its **drift speed (Vd)**.

But why don't the electrons accelerate? Why does current remain the same throughout the conductor? Because the electron's random movements _balance out_ the forward acceleration, making the **drift speed constant**.&#x20;

Again, we use positive charge carriers as the default. Electrons move with Vd opposite to the electric field. As speed is just a magnitude, both positive/negative charges would have the same drift speed (though opposite velocities).

To calculate drift velocity, we use the equation ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (12) (1) (1) (1).png>). (ne) is the _**charge carrier density**_, or amount of charge per unit volume (C/m^3). n would be the # of atoms (or electrons) per unit volume, whereas e is the charge of a single atom (or electron).
