# ohm's law

## V = IR           V = IR          V = IR            V = IR

**Ohm's law** asserts that current in a device (I) is ALWAYS directly proportional to the potential difference applied across the device (V). That is, when you graph their relationship, you get a _straight, linear line (slope dependent on resistance)._ Since the slope would be constant, his law implies that the resistance (R) of a device is _independent of V_ (unaffected by voltage). Of course, this is only true under **certain conditions**:&#x20;

1. the resistance of the conducting device is independent of the magnitude and polarity of the applied potential difference
2. the resistivity of the conducting material is independent of the magnitude and direction of the applied electric field (E ∝ V)

His law also implies that at a specific voltage, there can only be ONE possible value for the current depending on the resistance. This is the basis for resistance addition (series & parallel).

\*What if there are no resistors in a circuit? Well, all circuits have _some_ sort of resistance, unless they are ideal short circuits. Remember, resistors are just a kind of conductor that provides a specific value of resistance, so wires themselves still have resistance (just much smaller).
