# power in electric circuits

**Power (P)** is rate of work (energy transfer) over time, or W/dt (dU/dt). In a circuit, the potential drop between the battery terminals indicates a transfer of energy, since U = Vq. Rewriting it as dU = Vdq, we find dU = V(i\*dt). **P = dU/dt = iV**.

As charges flow through a resistor, some of its mechanical energy is _dissipated_ into thermal energy. The rate of electrical energy dissipation due to a resistance is ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (7).png>) or ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (8) (1).png>)

**P = iV** applies to ALL electrical energy transfers, whereas the above resistive formulas apply only in devices with a resistance (like wires in a circuit)!
