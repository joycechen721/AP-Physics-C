# magnetic fields B

### Magnets

Magnets are objects with 2 poles, North and South. Like poles repel, unlike poles attract. Wait...isn't this super similar to electric charge? No, one really big difference is that there are no single isolated magnetic poles in existence (monopoles). Therefore, when you cut a bar magnet, it doesn't separate into 1 South and 1 North half; it just creates another magnet with both poles. ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (11) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (14) (1).png>)

**Examples**

* compass needle - a bar magnet that can rotate freely. compass south points to geographic south pole, or magnetically the north pole.
* ferromagnetic materials - iron, cobalt, nickel, gadolinium, oxides/alloys. show strong attraction to magnetics & ability to form permanent magnets.

### Magnetic Fields (B vector)

Magnetic fields always point from the North to South pole. They are measured with the units Tesla (T), which stands for 1 N/A\*m.

Similar to electric field lines,

1. direction of B field is tangent to field line at any point
2. number of lines per unit area ‚àù B field strength&#x20;

Because magnetism requires a 3D perspective, we introduce a physics convention for vectors pointing into and out of the page (or screen).&#x20;
