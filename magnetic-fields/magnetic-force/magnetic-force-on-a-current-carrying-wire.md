# magnetic force on a current-carrying wire

As discussed previously, magnetic fields exert forces on moving charges & currents. This force is transmitted to the **wire itself**, since the conduction electrons can't "escape" out of the wire due to the force! Again, the force on a current/wire is a **cross product** of the length of the wire (L) \* current (i) and the magnetic field (B).

### Torque on a Current Loop

When a rectangular loop of wire carrying a current I is placed in a uniform magnetic field B, it experiences torque! Notice how force only acts on the long sides of the rectangular wire below, because the current || B on the short sides (sin0/180 = 0).&#x20;

The net torque is the sum of the torques acting on the two long sides of the wire: ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (25) (1).png>), where a = length of long side & b = length of short side.

If we have multiple loops, the net torque would be the # of loops (N) \* torque calculated above. a\*b = A, the area of the rectangular loop:![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (30) (1).png>)

### Magnetic Dipole Moment

Because a current-carrying coil placed in a magnetic field experiences torque, it behaves like a bar magnet placed in the magnetic field. Thus, similarly, a current-carrying coil is said to be a **magnetic dipole** (has 2 poles). To account for this, we assign a **magnetic dipole moment** to the coil of magnitude ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (9) (1).png>) where **N is the # of loops**, **i is the current** through the coil, and **A is the area of 1 loop**.

* Units of µ: Joules per Tesla (J/T)
* Direction of µ? Use right-hand rule: wrap hand in direction of coil current, and the thumb gives the direction of µ.
* The torque equation above can be simplified into the cross product of the magnetic dipole moment and the magnetic field the coil is in! ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (8) (1) (1).png>)

**Energy of Magnetic Dipole** = dot product (cos) of dipole moment & B vector **** ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png>)****

* **highest energy:** dipole moment points opposite of the magnetic field
* **lowest energy:** dipole moment points in direction of magnetic field
* **magnetic moment vector attempts to align with magnetic field**
