# magnetic force on a moving charge

### Magnetic Force on Moving Charge

When an electric **charge q** moves with **velocity v** through a **magnetic field B**, it'll experience a magnetic force Fb of magnitude ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (15).png>). Theta is the angle between v and B. Notice that the force is a **cross product** of the charge's velocity and B field. With this equation, we notice a few points:&#x20;

* if particle is stationary or has no charge, it will experience 0 net magnetic force.
* if velocity and magnetic field are parallel, there is 0 magnetic force on the particle
* because **force and velocity are never parallel**, the particle only **accelerates by direction** (speed remains the same, think centripetal motion).

Does the charge (+/-) of the particle matter then?? **YESSS. YESS. YES.**  If the particle is + charged, the force vector points in the direction of v x B. **If the particle is - charged, the force points opposite to the direction of v x B (hack: use left-hand instead of right-hand!).**&#x20;

### Circulating Charged Particle

If anything moves in a perfect circle, that means a force is acting on it towards the center.&#x20;

The same goes for charged particles moving in a magnetic field: ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (19).png>)&#x20;

The radius of the circle it creates is therefore: ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (20).png>)

### Crossed Electric & Magnetic Fields

Say a charge is simultaneously in an electric and magnetic field. Then it'll experience both electric force (F = qE) and magnetic force (F = qvB). Now, if the forces are perpendicular to one another (crossed) and cancel out, qE = qvB, and v = E/B. This is the essence of Thompson's cathode ray experiment, which helped with the discovery of the electron.&#x20;

Notice how the particle isn't deflected - because the forces are cancelled. In other words, **one particular speed (E/B)** will result in no deflection of the charged particle. **The magnetic field points INTO the page, so the magnetic force points upwards (for a positive particle).**

### Cross Products & Right-Hand Rule

In physics, we use the **right-hand rule** for cross products (sin). **Order matters for cross products!!** That is, the direction of the first multiplied vector is represented by the **index finger,** and the 2nd is represented by the **middle finger**. The resultant vector is perpendicular to both multiplied vectors, and is represented by the **thumb**.

In magnetism, velocity/current is the _a_ vector, the magnetic field is the _b_ vector, and the force is the _a x b_ vector.
