# magnetic force on a moving charge

### Magnetic Force on Moving Charge

When an electric **charge q** moves with **velocity v** through a **magnetic field B**, it'll experience a magnetic force Fb of magnitude ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (14).png>). Theta is the angle between v and B. Notice that the force is a **cross product** of the charge's velocity and B field. With this equation, we notice a few points:&#x20;

* if particle is stationary or has no charge, it will experience 0 net magnetic force.
* if velocity and magnetic field are parallel, there is 0 magnetic force on the particle
* because **force and velocity are never parallel**, the particle only **accelerates by direction** (speed remains the same, think centripetal motion).

Does the charge (+/-) of the particle matter then?? **YESSS. YESS. YES.**  If the particle is + charged, the force vector points in the direction of v x B. If the particle is - charged, the force points opposite to the direction of v x B (opposite of the thumb in right-hand rule).&#x20;

### Cross Products & Right-Hand Rule

In physics, we use the **right-hand rule** for cross products (sin). **Order matters for cross products!!** That is, the direction of the first multiplied vector is represented by the **index finger,** and the 2nd is represented by the **middle finger**. The resultant vector is perpendicular to both multiplied vectors, and is represented by the **thumb**.

In magnetism, velocity/current is the _a_ vector, the magnetic field is the _b_ vector, and the force is the _a x b_ vector.
