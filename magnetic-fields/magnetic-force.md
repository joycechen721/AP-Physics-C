# magnetic force

We'd expect that there'd be a magnetic force to go along with the magnetic field. Duh, YEAH there is. Magnetic fields are defined by the magnetic force it exerts on a moving charged particle.

There are 3 main types of magnetic forces we need to observe:

1. _MAGNET -> MOVING CHARGE_: Freely **moving** **charges** (not in wire) across a B field will experience a magnetic force.
2. _MAGNET -> CURRENT IN WIRE_: SInce magnetic fields affect moving charges, they should also affect currents, which are essentially charges that move in a "straight" line across a wire. **Magnets exert force on current-carrying wires.**
3. _CURRENT IN WIRE -> MAGNET_: Due to Newton's 3rd Law, the reverse of No.2 is true! Electric currents in a wire can produce a magnetic field & thus exerts force on a magnet.
