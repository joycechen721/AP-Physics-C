# magnetic force/fields due to current-carrying wire

We saw that magnetic forces can affect current-carrying wires. **Newton's Third Law** proves that the reverse can happen as well --> current-carrying wires can produce a magnetic field around it, affecting surrounding magnets. The magnetic field created by a **long straight wire** **w/ current i** is ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (16).png>)&#x20;
