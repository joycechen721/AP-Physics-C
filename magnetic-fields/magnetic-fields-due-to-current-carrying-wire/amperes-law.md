# ampere's law

Ampere's Law (arguably the magnetism ver. of gauss's law) basically states that the **integral of B\*d**_**ℓ** _ around a closed loop - **Amperian loop** - is equal to **µ0** \* the **total current I inside the loop**.

In most cases, the amperian loop will be circular for easier computation, since the integral of d_ℓ_ is just the circumference of the circle, 2πR. This law is super useful if you want to calculate the magnetic field due to many current-carrying wires, since all you need to do is find the total current I and divide it by the circumference of the amperian loop.

How do we find the total current?

Curl your **right hand** around the Amperian loop, with fingers pointing in direction of integration. A current through the loop in the direction of your thumb is positive, and a current in the opposite direction is negative. For the figure below, ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (21) (1) (1).png>) (ds = d_ℓ)._
