# magnetic fields due to current-carrying wire

We saw that magnetic forces can affect current-carrying wires. **Newton's Third Law** proves that the REVERSE can happen --> current-carrying wires can produce a magnetic field affecting surrounding magnets. The magnetic field created by a _**infinitely long**_** straight wire** **w/ current i** is &#x20;

![equation 0w0 - for reference](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (16).png>)

* B field varies with distance R from the wire. Greater distance = smaller magnetic field.
* µ0 = fundamental constant for permeability of free space = 4π \* 10^-7 T \* m/A

**Magnetic field lines** are circular-shaped (like coils!) with their centers on the wire. Use right-hand rule for the field direction (very veryy similar to finding magnetic dipole moment of a coil of wires).

### Biot-Savert Law

The Biot-Savert Law basically gives the magnetic field created by a small segment of current (i\*ds). If we define r as the distance to point P, ds as the length of the section of the current, and i as the current, then the magnetic field created is:

If we add all of these dB contributions (integration), we can get the TOTAL magnetic field due to the entire current. This law can be used to deduce equation 0w0 for an infinitely long wire.

### Force Between Two Parallel Wires

hmmm, what if we put 2 current-carrying wires (ccw) parallel to each other? since they not only create magnetic fields, but are also affected by them, they **exert forces on each other**!!!&#x20;

Say there is a ccw A and ccw B. To find the force A exerts on B, find the magnetic field created by A at the position where B is, using equation 0w0. Then, use the F = iLB equation by plugging A's magnetic field to find the force it exerts on B.&#x20;

In equation format: ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (19) (1) (1).png>) or ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (23) (1).png>).

In this above picture, B points downwards due to the right-hand rule (if you curl it towards the wire, the tangent of the curl points DOWN). Reversed (b -> a), B would point up on current a, so the force would be towards b. With this in mind, we can conclude that **parallel currents attract**, and **antiparallel currents repel**.
