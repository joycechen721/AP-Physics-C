# solenoids

A **solenoid** is basically a coil of wire that looks like this:&#x20;

### Magnetic Field of Solenoid

When a current runs through a solenoid, a magnetic field is formed within. When the length of the solenoid >>> its diameter, the magnetic field inside will actually be **parallel to its axis** and about **uniform**.&#x20;

The strength of the magnetic field inside a solenoid is given by the equation ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (21).png>), where **n** is the **number of turns per unit length** and **I** is the **current** running through the solenoid. n = N/L, where N = total # of turns and L = length of solenoid. For example, if a solenoid is 3 meters long with just 15 turns (HYPOTHETICALLY SPEAKING), then its n value would be 5 turns/m. The solenoid has 5 coils every meter. **If N & n increases by winding the wire more tightly, the magnetic field also inside increases.**

### Using Ampere's Law

Connecting back to Ampere's Law. The equation ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png>) can be derived&#x20;
